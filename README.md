# Model_Evaluation_And_Metrics

In the second assignment, I focused exclusively on evaluating a pre‑trained chest X‑ray classifier:

1. **Confusion Matrix Counts**  
   I wrote functions to compute true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives from prediction probabilities and ground‑truth labels.

2. **Core Metrics**  
   Building on those counts, I derived accuracy, prevalence, sensitivity (recall), specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Implementing these by hand deepened my understanding of what each metric really tells us.

3. **Curve Analysis**  
   I generated ROC curves and precision‑recall curves, computed AUC and average precision, and even plotted calibration curves to see how well predicted probabilities match actual outcomes.

4. **Statistical Confidence**  
   I wrote code to estimate confidence intervals around my metric estimates, giving a sense of how reliable each performance number is.
